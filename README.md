# weather-dashboard
In this challenge I created a weather dashboard from scratch. When the user types in a city and presses the button they are then shown the weather for that city and today's date. They are also presented with a five day forecast for the next five days. 

The UV Index changes colors depening on what he uv is in that city, letting them know whether or not it is safe.
